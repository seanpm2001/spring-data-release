== General Notes

* Make sure to <<setup,initially set-up your environment>>.
* Use the command `help` to get a list of all commands in the release tools.
* After fixing a problem use `workspace cleanup` to clean-up any mess left behind by the previous step.

== The release process

The <<pre-release,*Pre-Release tasks*>> and <<post-release,*Post-Release tasks*>> phases of making a release (opening tickets/closing tickets) is still done manually.

The <<create-release-tag,*Create Release Tag*>> and <<build,*Build and Distribute the Release*>> phase is what's covered by the CI server.

[[pre-release]]
=== 🍃 Pre-Release tasks

. Ensure all work on CVEs potentially contained in the release is done (incl. backports etc.).
. Upgrade dependencies in Spring Data Build parent pom (mind minor/major version rules).
. All release tickets are present (CLI: `$ tracker releasetickets $trainIteration`)
. Review open tickets for release.
. Self-assign release tickets  (CLI: `$ tracker prepare $trainIteration`)
. Announce release preparations to mailing list (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/spring-data-dev)
. 🚥 Continue with `Build and publish the release`

[[create-release-tag]]
=== 🥣 Create Release Tag

This can be done as a CI job, but can also be done locally in the event of error.

|Action
|Command

|Check out this repository from GitHub
|`$ git clone git@github.com:spring-projects/spring-data-release.git`

|Checkout the `main` branch
|`$ git checkout main`

|Edit `ci/release.properties` and assign the version number of the release train you wish to release to `release.version`. (Make sure it's NOT commented out!)
|

|Commit the change to this repository (but don't push to GitHub!)
|`$ git add ci/release.properties && git commit`

|Switch to the `create-release-tag` branch
|`$ git checkout create-release-tag`

|Set the `HEAD` to `main` to point the content to what is on `main`
|`$ git reset --hard main`

|🚨 *To trigger 🛣 the creation of the release tag* `git push` the `create-release-tag` branch
|`$ git push origin create-release-tag`

|Go to https://jenkins.spring.io/view/SpringData/job/spring-data-release-create-release-tag/, Navigate to the `create-release-tag` branch.
A job should have started. Click on the active job, and then click on *Open Blue Ocean*.
| Monitor the release preparation process.

|===

WARNING: If the tag creation goes wrong and got pushed to GitHub, you'll potentially have to clean up any commits, branches, and tags.

* 🚥 Continue with `Build and Distribute the Release` tasks.

[[build]]
=== 🌿 Build and Distribute the Release

You should have completed the previous section before starting this one.

|Switch to the `release` branch
|`$ git checkout release`

|Set the `HEAD` to `main` to point the content to what is on `main`
|`$ git reset --hard main`

|🚨 *To trigger 🛣 the release* `git push` the `release` branch
|`$ git push --force origin release`

|Go to https://jenkins.spring.io/view/SpringData/job/spring-data-release-build-and-distribute/, Navigate to the `release` branch.
A job should have started. Click on the active job, and then click on *Open Blue Ocean*.
| Monitor the release process.

The Jenkins pipeline will finish with the artifacts staged on either Maven Central or Artifactory.

WARNING: If this CI job fails, you can repeat this CI job. To do so, you must first delete any staged Maven Central/Artifactory artifacts. Then you can manually re-launch this job from Jenkins.

* For a Maven central release, go to https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/ and login.
** After logging in, you will find a closed Spring Data Release repository.
** Click the repository and then choose "Release".
* For an artifactory release, the release will already have been staged and promoted, so there is nothing more to do.
* 🚥 Continue with `Post-Release tasks`

*Background*
====
The release process has two key phases: *create a release tag* following by *build and publish*.
Once a release tag has been <<create-release-tag,created and pushed to GitHub>>, it's possible to do the <<build,second phase>> over and over until properly completed.
If this involves Artifactory, you'll have to clean up between attempts.
If this involves Maven Central, all you have to do is drop the release and start over.

* For a Maven Central release, you can visit https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/, login, and inspect the staged Spring Data Release. All the Spring Data modules will inside one repository.
* For a ilestone/RC release, you can visit https://repo.spring.io/. All the Spring Data modules will be there, each module a separate "build".

For milestone/RC releases, Spring Data Release tools automatically promotes them in Artifactory, so if you have to delete a build, you'll ALSO have to go and delete each module individually.

[[post-release]]
=== 🍀 Post-Release tasks

[%header,cols="1,1"]
|===
|Action
|Command

| Finally, push the commit that changed `release.properties` to `main`
| `$ git push origin main` (where you've checked out `spring-data-release`)

|Close release tickets.
|`$ tracker close $trainIteration`

|Create new release versions and tickets for upcoming version
|`$ tracker setup-next $trainIteration.next`

|Update versions in Sagan. `$targets` is given as comma separated lists of code names, without spaces. E.g. `Moore,Neumann`
|`$ sagan update $releasetrains`

|Create list of docs for release announcements
|`$ announcement $trainIteration`

|Announce release (Blog, Twitter) and notify downstream dependency projects as needed.

Congratulations 🥳 You completed the release ❤️.

=== Appendix

[[setup]]
==== One Time Setup

===== Infrastructure requirements

* Ensure you have the credentials for `buildmaster` accounts on https://repo.spring.io.
* Ensure you have the credentials for https://oss.sonatype.org (to deploy and promote GA and service releases, need deployment permissions for `org.springframework.data`) in `settings.xml` for server with id `sonatype`.

Both are available in the Spring/Pivotal Last Pass repository.

===== Prepare local configuration and credentials

Add an `application-local.properties` to the project root and add the following properties:

* `git.username` - Your GitHub username.
* `git.password` - Your GitHub Password (or API key with scopes: `public_repo, read:org, repo:status, repo_deployment, user` when using 2FA).
* `git.author` - Your full name (used for preparing commits).
* `git.email` - Your email (used for preparing commits).
* `maven.mavenHome` - Pointing to the location of your Maven installation.
* `deployment.username` - Your Artifactory user.
* `deployment.api-key` - The Artifactory API key to use for artifact promotion.
* `deployment.password` - The encrypted Artifactory password..
* `gpg.keyname` - The GPG key name.
* `gpg.passphrase` - The password of your GPG key.
* `gpg.executable` - Path to your GPG executable, typically `/usr/local/MacGPG2/bin/gpg2`
 or `/usr/local/bin/gpg`.
* `sagan.key` - Sagan authentication token. Must be a valid GitHub token. Can be the same
 as `git.password` when using a GitHub token as password.

After that, run the `verify` command (`$ verify`) to verify your settings (authentication,
correct Maven, Java, and GPG setup).

See `application-local.template` for details.

==== Utilities

===== GitHub Labels

`ProjectLabelConfiguration` contains a per-project configuration which labels should be present in a project. To apply that configuration (create or update), use:

----
$ github update labels $project
----

===== Dependency Upgrade

`ProjectDependencies` contains a per-project configuration of dependencies.

Workflow:

* Check for dependency upgrades `$ dependency check $trainIteration`

Reports upgradable dependencies for Build and Modules and
creates `dependency-upgrade-build.properties` file.
Edit `dependency-upgrade-build.properties` to specify the dependency version to upgrade.
Removing a line will omit that dependency upgrade.

* Apply dependency upgrade with `$ dependency upgrade $trainIteration`. Applies dependency
 upgrades currently only to Spring Data Build.
* Report store-specific dependencies to Spring Boot's current upgrade
 ticket (https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/24036[sample]) `$ dependency report $trainIteration`

===== CI Properties Distribution

To distribute `ci/pipeline.properties` across all modules use:

`$ infra distribute ci-properties $trainIteration`
